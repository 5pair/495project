This project was my senior design project at the University of Alabama. Using Java and MongoDB, a group of 4 came up with a problem (from scratch) and
designed an Android application with which we hoped to tackle it.  

The problem that we chose to address was finding a way to access wait times and additional information for dining establishments/bars.
We were to follow all steps of the software design process.
